###### SWSH Victory Station Doubles (VGC 2021 Series 7) ######

# This file contains all of the sets for SWSH Victory 
# Station Doubles, and is compiled into JSON format 
# for use with Pokemon Showdown using a Python script.

# There were a lot of 'Victory Station Doubles' formats
# to choose from in Sword and Shield, so I may end up
# implementing a few different formats for it. For now,
# I've decided to focus just on Series 7 (Basically 
# national dex) and potentially Spikemuth Cup if 
# there is enough demand.

##### File Format:
# Anything enclosed in [] is optional
# Any line starting with '#' is commented
# and will be ignored by the compiler 

# Comments do not currently work in the middle of lines!
